Perform Host Discovery using Nmap
The Nmap - Zenmap GUI appears; in the Command field, type the command nmap -sn -PR <Target IP Address> (here, the target IP address is 10.10.1 0.16) and click Scan.
Note: -sn: disables port scan and -PR: perfonns ARP ping scan.
8. The scan results appear, indicating that the target Host is up, 

In the Command field, type nmap -sn -PU <Target IP Address>, (Here, the target IP address is 10.10.10.16) and click Scan. The scan results
appear, indicating the target Host is up,.
Note: -PU: performs d1e UDP ping scan

Now, we will perform d1e ICMP ECHO ping sean. In the Command field, type nmap -sn -PE <Target IP Address>, (here, the target IP address is 10.10.10.16) and click Scan. }
The sean results appear, indicating that the target Host is up, .
Note: -PE: performs ilie ICMP ECHO ping scan.

Now, we will perform an ICMP ECHO ping sweep to discover live hosts from a range of target IP addresses. In the Command field, 
type nmap -sn -PE <Target Range of IP Addresses> (Here, the target range of IP addresses is 10.10.10.11-20) and click Scan. The sean results appear,
indicating the target Host is up,

ICMP Tirnestarnp and Address Mask Ping Sean: These techniques are alternatives for the tradicional ICMP ECHO ping can, which are used to determine whether the target host 
is live specifically when administrators block the ICMP ECHO pings.
Example -
ICMP timestamp ping sean
# nmap -sn -PP <target IP address> 
ICMP address mask ping scan
# nmap -sn -PM <target IP address>
TCP SYN Ping Sean: This technique sends empty TCP SYN packets to the target host, ACK response means that the host is active.
# nmap -sn -PS <target IP address>
TCP ACK Ping Scan: This technique sends empty TCP ACK packets to the target host; an RST response means that the host is active.
# nmap -sn -PA <target IP address>
IP Protocol Ping Scan : This technique sends different probe packets of different IP protocols to the target host, any response from
any probe indicates that a host is active.
# nmap -sn -PO <target IP address>

Angry IP Scanner

In the Windows 10 virtual machine, navigate to E:\CEH-Tools\CEHv11 Module 03 Scanning Networks\Ping Sweep Tools\Angry IP Scanner and
double-click ipscan-win64-3.6.1.exe
In the IP Range fields, type the IP range as 10.10.10.0 to 10.10.10.255 and click the Preferences icon beside the IP Range menu
The Preferences window appears. In the Scanning tab, under the Pinging section, select the Pinging method as Combined UDP+TCP from the drop-down list.
Now, switch to the Display tab. U nder the Display in the results list section, select the Alive hosts (responding to pings) only radio button and click OK
In the IP Range - Angry IP Scanner window, click the Start button to start scanning the IP range that you entered.
Angry IP Scanner starts scanning the IP range and begins to list out the alive hosts found. Check the progress bar on the bottom-right comer to
see the progress of the scanning.
After the scanning is completed, a Scan Statistics pop-up appears. Note the total number of Hosts alive (here, 6) and click Close

MegaPing

4. The MegaPing - lnstallShield Wizard window appears; click Next and follow the wizard-driven installation steps to install MegaPing.
Select the IP Scanner option from the left pane. In the IP Scanner tab in the right-hand pane, enter the IP range in the From and To fields; in
this lab, the IP range is 10.10.1 0.5 to 10.10.1 0.20; then, click Start
Select the Port Scanner option from the left-hand pane. In the Port Scanner tab in the right-hand pane, enter the IP address of the Windows Server 2016
(10.10.10.16) machine into the Destination Address List field and click Add.
Select the 10.10.10.16 checkbox and click the Start button to start listening to the traffic on 10.10.10.16.
MegaPing lists the ports associated with Windows Server 2016 (10.10.10.16), with detailed information on port number and type,
service running on the port along with d1e description, and associated risk

In the Windows 10 virtual machine, click on the Start menu and launch the Nmap - Zenmap GUI from the applications
The Nmap • Zenmap GUI appears; in the Command field, type the command nmap -sT -v <T arget IP Address> (here, the target IP address is 10.10.1 0.16) and click Scan.
Note: -sT : performs the TCP connect/ full open sean and -v: enables the verbose output (include all hosts and ports in the output).
Now, switch to the Windows 10 virtual machine. In the Command field of Z enmap, 
type the command nmap -sS -v <Target IP Address> (here, the target IP address is 10.10.1 0.16) and click Scan.
Note: -sS: performs the stealth scan/ TCP half-open sean and -v: enables the verbose output (include all hosts and ports in the output).
In the Command field o f Zenmap, type the command nmap -sX -v <Target IP Address> (here, the target IP address is 10.10.10.16) and click Scan.
Note: -sX : performs the Xmas sean and -v: enables the verbose output (include all hosts and ports in the output).
In the Command field, type the command nmap -sM -v <Target IP Address> (here, the target IP address is 10.10.10.16) and click Scan
Note: -sM: performs the TCP Maimon scan and -v: enables the verbose output (include all hosts and ports in the output).
In the Command field, type the command nmap -sA -v <Target IP Address> (here, d1e target IP address is 10.10.10.16) and click Scan.
Note: -sA: performs the ACK flag probe sean and -v: enables the verbose output (include all hosts and ports in the output).
Now, return to the Windows 10 virtual maehine. In the Command field, type the command nmap -sU -v <Target IP Address> (here, the target IP
