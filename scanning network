Perform Host Discovery using Nmap
The Nmap - Zenmap GUI appears; in the Command field, type the command nmap -sn -PR <Target IP Address> (here, the target IP address is 10.10.1 0.16) and click Scan.
Note: -sn: disables port scan and -PR: perfonns ARP ping scan.
8. The scan results appear, indicating that the target Host is up, 

In the Command field, type nmap -sn -PU <Target IP Address>, (Here, the target IP address is 10.10.10.16) and click Scan. The scan results
appear, indicating the target Host is up,.
Note: -PU: performs d1e UDP ping scan

Now, we will perform d1e ICMP ECHO ping sean. In the Command field, type nmap -sn -PE <Target IP Address>, (here, the target IP address is 10.10.10.16) and click Scan. }
The sean results appear, indicating that the target Host is up, .
Note: -PE: performs ilie ICMP ECHO ping scan.

Now, we will perform an ICMP ECHO ping sweep to discover live hosts from a range of target IP addresses. In the Command field, 
type nmap -sn -PE <Target Range of IP Addresses> (Here, the target range of IP addresses is 10.10.10.11-20) and click Scan. The sean results appear,
indicating the target Host is up,

ICMP Tirnestarnp and Address Mask Ping Sean: These techniques are alternatives for the tradicional ICMP ECHO ping can, which are used to determine whether the target host 
is live specifically when administrators block the ICMP ECHO pings.
Example -
ICMP timestamp ping sean
# nmap -sn -PP <target IP address> 
ICMP address mask ping scan
# nmap -sn -PM <target IP address>
TCP SYN Ping Sean: This technique sends empty TCP SYN packets to the target host, ACK response means that the host is active.
# nmap -sn -PS <target IP address>
TCP ACK Ping Scan: This technique sends empty TCP ACK packets to the target host; an RST response means that the host is active.
# nmap -sn -PA <target IP address>
IP Protocol Ping Scan : This technique sends different probe packets of different IP protocols to the target host, any response from
any probe indicates that a host is active.
# nmap -sn -PO <target IP address>
