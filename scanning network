Perform Host Discovery using Nmap
The Nmap - Zenmap GUI appears; in the Command field, type the command nmap -sn -PR <Target IP Address> (here, the target IP address is 10.10.1 0.16) and click Scan.
Note: -sn: disables port scan and -PR: perfonns ARP ping scan.
8. The scan results appear, indicating that the target Host is up, 

In the Command field, type nmap -sn -PU <Target IP Address>, (Here, the target IP address is 10.10.10.16) and click Scan. The scan results
appear, indicating the target Host is up,.
Note: -PU: performs d1e UDP ping scan

Now, we will perform d1e ICMP ECHO ping sean. In the Command field, type nmap -sn -PE <Target IP Address>, (here, the target IP address is 10.10.10.16) and click Scan. }
The sean results appear, indicating that the target Host is up, .
Note: -PE: performs ilie ICMP ECHO ping scan.

Now, we will perform an ICMP ECHO ping sweep to discover live hosts from a range of target IP addresses. In the Command field, 
type nmap -sn -PE <Target Range of IP Addresses> (Here, the target range of IP addresses is 10.10.10.11-20) and click Scan. The sean results appear,
indicating the target Host is up,

ICMP Tirnestarnp and Address Mask Ping Sean: These techniques are alternatives for the tradicional ICMP ECHO ping can, which are used to determine whether the target host 
is live specifically when administrators block the ICMP ECHO pings.
Example -
ICMP timestamp ping sean
# nmap -sn -PP <target IP address> 
ICMP address mask ping scan
# nmap -sn -PM <target IP address>
TCP SYN Ping Sean: This technique sends empty TCP SYN packets to the target host, ACK response means that the host is active.
# nmap -sn -PS <target IP address>
TCP ACK Ping Scan: This technique sends empty TCP ACK packets to the target host; an RST response means that the host is active.
# nmap -sn -PA <target IP address>
IP Protocol Ping Scan : This technique sends different probe packets of different IP protocols to the target host, any response from
any probe indicates that a host is active.
# nmap -sn -PO <target IP address>

In the Windows 10 virtual machine, click on the Start menu and launch the Nmap - Zenmap GUI from the applications
The Nmap • Zenmap GUI appears; in the Command field, type the command nmap -sT -v <T arget IP Address> (here, the target IP address is 10.10.1 0.16) and click Scan.
Note: -sT : performs the TCP connect/ full open sean and -v: enables the verbose output (include all hosts and ports in the output).
Now, switch to the Windows 10 virtual machine. In the Command field of Z enmap, 
type the command nmap -sS -v <Target IP Address> (here, the target IP address is 10.10.1 0.16) and click Scan.
Note: -sS: performs the stealth scan/ TCP half-open sean and -v: enables the verbose output (include all hosts and ports in the output).
In the Command field o f Zenmap, type the command nmap -sX -v <Target IP Address> (here, the target IP address is 10.10.10.16) and click Scan.
Note: -sX : performs the Xmas sean and -v: enables the verbose output (include all hosts and ports in the output).

N ote: -sA: performs the ACK flag probe sean and -v: enables the verbose output (include all hosts and ports in the output)

Systema operativo

The Zenmap GUI appears. In the Command field, type the command nmap -A <Target IP Address> (here, the target machine is Windows Server 2016 [10.10.10.16]) and click Scan.
Note: -A: to perform an aggressive scan.
In the Command field, type the command nmap -O <Target IP Address> (Here, the targe machine is Windows Server 2016 (10.10.10.16]) and click Scan.

scanning beyond the firewall

Scan a Target Network using Metasploit

In the Parrot Terminal window, type service postgresql start and hit Enter.
Now, type msfconsole and hit Enter to launch Metasploit
An msf command line appears. Type db_status and hit Enter to check if Metasploit has connected to the data base successfully. If you receive the
message "postgersql selected, no connection," then the database did not connect to msf.
Note: I f the message you receive is "connected to msf," then skip to Step #14.
Exit the Metasploit framework by typing exit and press Enter. Then, to initiate thee database, type msfdb init, and press Enter
To restart thee postgresql service, type service postgresql restart and press Enter. Now, start the Metasploit Framework again by typing
msfconsole and pressing Enter
Check the data base status by typing db_status and press Enter. This time, the database should successfully connect to msf
Type nmap -Pn -sS -A -oX Test 10.10.10.0/24 and hit Enter to scan the subnet
After the sean completes, Nmap displays the number of active hosts in the target network
Now, type db_import Test and hit Enter to import the Nmap results from the database
Type hosts and hit Enter to view the list of active hosts along with their MAC addresses, OS names, etc
Type services or db_services and hit Enter to receive a list of the services running on the active hosts
Type search portscan and hit Enter. The Metasploit port scanning modules appear
Here, we will use the auxiliary/scanner/portscan/syn module to perform an SYN scan on the target systems. To do so, type
use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/syn and press Enter.
22. We will use this module to perform an SYN sean against the target IP address range (10.10.10.5-20) to look for open port 80 through the ethO interface.
Todo so, issue the below commands:
• set INTERFACE ethO
• set PORTS 80
• set RHOSTS 10.10.10.5-20
• set THREADS 50
Note: PORTS: specifies the ports to sean (e.g., 22-25,80, 110-900), RHOSTS: specifies the target address range or CIDR identifier, and THREADS: specifies
the number of concurrent threads (default 1).
After specifying the above values, type run, and press Enter to initiate the sean against the target IP address range
To load the am¡iliary/scanner/portscan/tcp module, type use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp and press Enter.
27. Type hosts -R and press Enter to automatically set this option with the discovered hosts present in our database. Or Type set RHOSTS <Target IP Address> and press Enter.
Note: Here, we will perform a TCP sean for open ports on a single IP address (10.10.10.16), as scanning multiple IP addresses consumes much time
Type run and press Enter to discover open TCP ports in the target system.
29. The results appear, displaying all open TCP ports in the target IP address (10.10.10.16).
To do so, first type back, and then press Enter to revert to the msf command line. Then, type use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version and press Enter.
32. We will use this module to run a SMB version sean against the target IP address range (10.10.10.5-20). Todo so, issue the below commands:
> set RHOSTS 10.10.10.5-20
> set THREADS 11
Type run and press Enter to display the SMB versions of the target hosts

While perfonning a sean using Nmap, we diseovered that the FTP port 21 is open on the host 10.10.10.1O in the target network. Now, we will
scan the target host to identify the FTP version.
35. Type back and press Enter. To load an FTP module, type use auxiliary/scanner/ftp/ftp_version and press Enter.
36. Type set RHOSTS 10.10.10.10 and press Enter to specify the target host
Type run and press Enter to initiate d1e FTP version identifieation scan.
38. The result appears, displaying the FTP version details of the target host
Type hosts and press Enter to view detailed information on active hosts in the target network. 
You can further export this information toa CSV file. Todo so, first type back, and then press Enter. Now, type hosts -o /root/Desktop/Metasploit_Scan_Results.csv and press Enter
Navigate to the location /root/Desktop and double-click the Metasploit_Scan_Results.csv file. The CSV file appears, displaying
detailed information on the active hosts in the target IP range
